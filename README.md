# Text-To-Speech-Converter
This project is a real-time object detection system using OpenCVâ€™s DNN module and a pre-trained TensorFlow model (frozen_inference_graph.pb). It detects and labels objects in video or images using MobileNet SSD architecture trained on the COCO dataset, enabling efficient and fast visual recognition tasks.
